### Test embeddings

To test the embeddings learned by DeezyMatch:

1. We create a simple dataset and call it `tests.csv` (already located in `./candidates/tests.csv`). Note that column 2 and 3 are omitted in the process. This will be changed in the next version of DeezyMatch (XXX).

2. Generate vectors for all queries: (Note that `-qc q` which sets the `query_candidate_mode` to `query`).

```bash
python modelInference.py -m ../models/test_model.model -d ./candidates/tests.csv -v ../vocabs/test_model.pickle -i ../input_dfm.yaml -n 10000 -mode generate_vectors -qc q
``` 

3. compare the embeddings (the inputs can be changed in the header):

```bash
python compare_embeddings.py
```

Depending on your model, the results may significantly differ from what we report here:

```bash
                       string to compare,                         reference string, l2_norm

# Candidate selection

1. Generate vectors for all queries: (Note that `-qc q` which sets the `query_candidate_mode` to `query`).

```bash
python modelInference.py -m ../models/test_model.model -d ./candidates/tests.csv -v ../vocabs/test_model.pickle -i ../input_dfm.yaml -n 10000 -mode generate_vectors -qc q
``` 

2. Generate vectors for all candidates: (Note that `-qc c` which sets the `query_candidate_mode` to `candidate`)

```bash
python modelInference.py -m ../models/test_model.model -d ./candidates/tests.csv -v ../vocabs/test_model.pickle -i ../input_dfm.yaml -n 10000 -mode generate_vectors -qc c
``` 

3. Combine vectors. This step is required if candidates or queries are distributed on several files (e.g., candidates are in 5 separate files. For each file, steps 1-2 should be repeated. This results in 5 fwd and bwd embeddings). At this step, we combined those vectors.

```bash
python combineVecs.py -p embed_candidates/rnn_fwd* -p_id embed_candidates/rnn_indxs_0 -df df/candidates.df -n candidates_fwd -o combined
python combineVecs.py -p embed_candidates/rnn_bwd* -p_id embed_candidates/rnn_indxs_0 -df df/candidates.df -n candidates_bwd -o combined
python combineVecs.py -p embed_queries/rnn_fwd* -p_id embed_queries/rnn_indxs_0 -df df/queries.df -n queries_fwd -o combined
python combineVecs.py -p embed_queries/rnn_bwd* -p_id embed_queries/rnn_indxs_0 -df df/queries.df -n queries_bwd -o combined
```

4. Find candidates:

NOTE: currently, the user needs to open the candidateFinder source code and change `# ----- COMBINE VECTORS, USER` section. There are many ways to combined the vectors, and we will move this to a function once we are happy with the process.

```bash
python candidateFinder.py -fd 0.8 -n 10 -o test_candidates_deezymatch -sz 4
```
